    "\n",
    "A $p$-value on the other hand is virtually speaking giving us such an $\\alpha$ based on the observed $t$, i.e. expressed the probability\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(|z|>|t|)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "of having a $z$ randomly produced by the distribution corresponding to the null-hypothesis value $w_j=w_j^0$ with even higher $|z|$ compared to the observed $|t|$. This can be interpreted as a likelihood that the observed value of $t$ is got just by chance given $w_j=w_j^0$. If this likelihood is lower than a certain threshold value (usually $5\\%$) this is interpreted as having an equation $w_j=w_j^0$ too unlikely, i.e. having to reject the hypothesis $H_0$. Otherwise, if $p-value$ is higher than a threshold value ($>5\\%$) this means that the null-hypothesis can not be rejected with sufficient confidence (of at least $95\\%$) so this might be the case that the regressor does not have a significant impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that $p$-value is not supposed to prove any specific estimate for the coefficient $w_j$ - it can only make us confident (or uncertain on the contrary) that $w_j\\neq 0$ (or different from another value of interest). Also having a low $p$-values do not prove that the impact of $x_i$ on $y$ is actually linear. In turn, having high $p$-value by itself does not prove that $y$ is independent on $x_i$ (first of all - a linear impact could still be there despite being seen as unlikely, just disguised by noise; second - the actual impact could be non-linear, i.e. not subject to being described by a linear model; third - an impact of the considered regressor might be affected by an overlap with the impact of the other regressors, so it might not be impactful after others are considered, but it might still be impactful by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regressors having high $p$-values are usually not included into the final model in order to stay free from the random insignificnt effects, reducing the risk of overfitting. This is however not the only way of fighting it. Also sequentually excluding regressors based on their $p$-values is not necessarily the best way of the feature selection as high $p$-values might result from multicollinearity, i.e. from having an impact of the considered regressor overlap with the impact of others. And it might happen that excluding other regressors in the first place will better help with fighting the overfitting and also might lead to the decrease of the $p$-values of the remaining regressors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis testing: F-statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "However often we need to test the significance of a subgroup of regressors together (or all of the regressors) testing the entire model against the null-hypothesis that a model based on a smaller subset of $m$ regressors (or just the intercept) of the regressors actually performs not worse than the original one.  The following $F$-statistics helps with that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F=\\frac{(RSS_0-RSS_1)(N-n)}{RSS_1\\cdot (n-m)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $RSS_1$ is the optimal (least-square) $RSS$ value for the original regression and $RSS_0$ - is the optimal $RSS$ value of the regression based on the considered subset of $m$ regressors (testing the hypothesis that only those $m$ regressors are significant). If we only consider a cumulative impact of all the regressors vs a trivial regression having just the intercept, then $m-1$ and $F$-statitics could be expressed through $R^2$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F=\\frac{R^2 (N-n)}{(1-R^2)(n-1)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R and python will report the value of $F$ for the null-hypothesis that only the intercept is significant, as well as the $p$-value characterizing this $F$-statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $F$-statistics above is a critical value corresponding to a certain level of confidence $1-\\alpha$ (or if the corresponding $p$-value is below the threshold $\\alpha$ one rejects the null-hypothesis of having all the considered regressors together insignificant. Otherwise this hypothesis can not be rejected, so it might be the case that regressors do not really have an impact. But once again $F$-statistics can not prove any specific estimates for the coefficients, nor can it prove a linear impact of those regressors."

    "But mind the fact that variance will actually depend on the sample sizes and there is no direct correspondence - it was coincidental that the std of our experiments largely matched standard error reported in the regression summary. Those are different concepts. This experiment is just an illustration of the idea. A more robust way of explaining it would employ Bayesian thinking:\n",
    "Consider a regression $$y\\sim w\\cdot x$$ or its probabilistic form $y\\sim N(wx,\\sigma^2)$ given the observed $Data$. Then one can assess the joint likelihood of the $Data=\\{(x^i,y^i)\\}$ given the choice of the model coefficient $w$ as\n",

If we do not really have any we can assume $p(w)=const$ over a certain interval of reasonable values and then a distribution for $w$ could be defined through a simple proportionality relationship $p(w|Data)\\sim p(Data|w)$ over this interval. Alternatively we can assume $p(w)=N(0,(\\sigma^*)^2)$ with $\\sigma^*$ large enough, which will lead to normal distribution for $p(w|Data)$ in case $\\sigma^*$ were known upfront."
